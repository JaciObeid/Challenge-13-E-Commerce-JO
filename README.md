## Challenge-13-E-Commerce-JO
This is Jaci Obeidzinski's Challenge for Module 13. This is a postgresSQL data base for an ecommerce inventory. This allows insomnia to see all products, categories and tags as well as update, create and delete said items. 

## How to Install
First you will need install the code onto your personal computer. Then you will need to create a postgreSQL database with the name ecommerce_db and seed it with relevent infromation to you(or use the seed files for fun). Then you can open the terminal and run the program using node server.js and open insomina to your wanted function.
